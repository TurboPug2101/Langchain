    "6. **Optimized for High-Dimensional Data**  \n",
    "   - Efficiently handles high-dimensional vector spaces, such as embeddings used in machine learning and NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Low Memory Usage**  \n",
    "   - FAISS provides memory-efficient solutions using compression techniques like product quantization (PQ).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Integration with ML Pipelines**  \n",
    "   - FAISS can be easily integrated into machine learning pipelines for tasks like recommendation systems and document retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases of FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Recommendation Systems**  \n",
    "   - FAISS can be used to find similar items for recommendation based on user interaction data or content embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Image and Video Search**  \n",
    "   - Efficiently finds similar images or videos in large datasets by searching over their feature vectors (e.g., in image recognition tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  \n",
    "   - Used for tasks like finding similar word embeddings or document embeddings for information retrieval or clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Anomaly Detection**  \n",
    "   - FAISS can help detect outliers by finding nearest neighbors and measuring the similarity of vectors in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clustering in High-Dimensional Spaces**  \n",
    "   - Enables fast clustering of large datasets by finding nearest neighbors and grouping similar data points efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Search in Large Vector Databases**  \n",
    "   - Used in search engines and information retrieval systems that need to search over large sets of vectorized data, such\n"
